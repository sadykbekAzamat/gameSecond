My second game: Attack and War


I made the project entirely myself.
90% of the sprites were taken from the Internet.
The game uses Firebase Realtime Database. And Photon Pun 2 was used for the online game.
The game is fully ad-supported and monetization enabled. Monetization is done through Unity.
